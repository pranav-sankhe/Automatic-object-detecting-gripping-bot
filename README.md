# Automatic-object-detecting-gripping-bot

Yo Peeps!!

In winter vacations of my 1st year at IIT Bombay apart from infi lukkhagiri ,I made a simple Bot.
My bot had the following functionalities: If we place the bot in suurounding of many objects, it scans
the area around it and locates the nearest object . After it is done with scanning the bot orients itself
according to the object and moves towards it. After reaching at the position of object the gripper attached 
to the bot operates and grips the object .
